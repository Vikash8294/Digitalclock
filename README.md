## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
**Project Title:** Digital Clock  
**Instructor:** Dr. Prateek Raj Gautam  
**Submitted By:** Vikash Kumar Singh  
**SAP ID:** 590014667

## ðŸ“œ Project Description:
The **Digital Clock** project is a simple yet functional digital clock built using Python's **Tkinter** library. The clock displays the current time in a digital format (HH:MM:SS) and updates every second. It is an excellent tool for learning how to work with Tkinter widgets, managing time, and creating a responsive interface.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features:
- **Real-Time Display:** Shows the current local time in a **HH:MM:SS** format.
- **Automatic Update:** The clock updates every second, providing an accurate representation of the time.
- **Simple and Elegant Interface:** The clock has a clean and minimalist design using **Tkinter** for the user interface.
- **Customizable Design:** The font, size, and window properties are customizable, allowing for easy modifications.

## ðŸš€ How to Use:
1. **Run the Application**:
   To launch the application, open a terminal or command prompt and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python DigitalClock.py
   ```

2. **View the Digital Clock**:
   Once the application is running, the current time will be displayed in a large, digital font in the center of the window.

3. **Time Updates Automatically**:
   The clock will automatically update every second, displaying the accurate time.

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used:
- **Tkinter:** Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying the digital clock.
- **time:** Pythonâ€™s built-in library for working with time-related functions, used to retrieve and format the current time.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes:
- The application uses a simple **after()** method to update the clock every second, ensuring that the time remains accurate and the display is always up-to-date.
- The window size and text styling can be easily customized to meet your design preferences.
